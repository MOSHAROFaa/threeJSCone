Here I used the three.js project.
My works,
1. In each element I added in the 3D Object, It was the first name of my friend together with his age & his gender.
2. Made the male "M" as blue and the female "F" as pink.
3. Added a new button named "CONE".
4. The cone button is clickable. Users can click the cone button and visualize the cone shape.
